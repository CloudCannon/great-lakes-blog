You may first notice that we have a dazzling outdoor quad flanked on three sides by our spectacular New Dorm, our stunningly historic Old Dorm, and the coziest commons on campus. It is inside, though, that you will truly get to experience the welcoming and warm spirit of your new Will Rice family."
